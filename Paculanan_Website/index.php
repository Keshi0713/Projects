                <h2>Welcome to Cat Distribution System</h2>
                <p>The Cat Distribution System (CDS) refers to the network and processes involved in the production, storage, and delivery of cat-related products, such as food, 
					accessories, and veterinary supplies, to consumers. This system includes manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and logistics providers who work together to ensure that cat products are available in stores, online platforms, and directly to customers. The distribution network must adapt to customer demands, shipping logistics, and regional variations to ensure timely delivery and product availability. With the increasing popularity of pet ownership, the CDS has become an essential part of the pet care industry.</p>
